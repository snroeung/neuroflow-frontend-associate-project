# Neuroflow Frontend Associate Coding Assessment

This project is created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)/React frontend framework. This framework is used as I am most familiar with React among all frontend frameworks and is most suitable for this project. I used the Table component from the library [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/table/) because I can easily format the table and it already provides the styling for the component. I also used the library [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) to format the dates based on the requirements.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
